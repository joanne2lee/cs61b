# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: I did not think of the tesselation as columns of hexagons, which would have made my code a lot more simple. I learned to really break down the problem and try to approach it by looking at it from a simplified perspective.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: In similar ways, there is a repetition of elements. In project three, rooms and hallways are used like hexagons to create a tesselation.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would work on creating the simpler elements first, starting my approach with the hallways and rooms.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: Rooms are rectangular spaces while hallways are restricted to a width of 1 or 2. Both are formed by walls, however, and are connected.
