Our BSTMap is comparable to the built in structures (TreeMap and HashMap) in that they are able to handle very large input sizes.
The ULLMap, however, takes longer to run as the input size increases, and eventually leads to a "Stack Overflow."
At this point, it seems that the HashMap is the only structure that maintains constant time, while the TreeMap shows an increase in runtime,
as well as our BSTMap to a greater extent.
