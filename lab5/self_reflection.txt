You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I wrote two different helper methods for finding the circular index (oneMore and oneLess), when I could have used the modulo operator to write just one helper method (wrapIndex). 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I came up with correct implementations for the add and remove methods. The methods were also consistent in style/steps.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: In my resize method, I used separate indices for the old and new arrays, when I could have just used one.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would be more conscious about not writing redundant code.
